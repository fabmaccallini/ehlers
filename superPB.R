# Strategy
#
# Buy on the filter crossing above its -RMS line
# Short on the filter crossing below its RMS line
# Exit long when the filter either crosses below its RMS or crosses below -RMS (which signifies a false entry signal)
# Cover short when the filter either crosses above its -RMS or crosses above RMS (which signifies a false entry signal)
